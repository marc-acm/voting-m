# VOTING MACHINE

This APP created in Ruby works like a Voting Machine.

### Prerequisites
- Ruby 2.4 
- Text Editor (e.g. Atom, Sublime)
- Terminal (for Mac) or Windows Powershell

### Installing
The first thing to do is to make sure that you have installed Ruby and a Text Editor in your system.

### Running the App
On a Terminal or Powershell run the program by locating the directory of the file and calling "ruby filename.rb". 

### How The App Works
It provides a selection of candidates.  The system will ask for the voter's name followed by entering the selected candidate's name.
It will then ask to enter to go back to the List of Candidates and will ask another voter.

The system clears up and will only show the main Selection.  In this example there are four candidates and five voters.
Once all five have voted, type the "exit" to view the result.

The next view, will show the tally of votes and the emerging winner.
